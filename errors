Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/dists/stable/Release Unable to find expected entry
 ‘main/binary-i386/Packages’ in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

 Fix
  1. Open a new Terminal window and run the following command (assuming you’re on the Stable Channel, if not, see the featured comment):
      sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
  2. In the text file that opens edit the file so that the line reads:
      deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main
      The only addition you need to make is entering the [amd64] architecture after ‘deb’ but preceding the ‘http’.
      Do not edit or replace any other text in this file.
  3. Hit Save. Close the vi.
      Now return to the Terminal and refresh your package list by running:
      sudo apt-get update
