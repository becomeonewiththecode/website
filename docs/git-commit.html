git commit

Ammending a commit.

Sometimes you commit a change you just completed, you test and notice a spelling error or something else which then require more minor changes. This interation can go on an on and will results in multiple small commits with these minor chagnes, what if you could alter a ommit, well there is such a command.

git commit --ammend

The above command is creating a new commti but creates a pointer to the commit you specified with the command, that commit is not visible using the log.
